CoderDojo - Web Development
===========================

This repository contains lessons and examples.  

Programming is all about incremental development, which is similar to the learning process - step by step.

We hope you enjoy the lessons.  We are looking forward to seeing what you can create!


Lessons
=======

#### Lesson 1:1 - The Basics

Covers just getting a file created and displaying in a web browser.  It then covers what tags are and introduces a couple basic tags to experiment with.  Finally it introduces proper HTML document structure.
	
#### Lesson 1:2 - Mark-up vs. Presentation

This session covers the difference between what is in a program file and what gets displayed on the screen.  It then introduces several new fundamental HTML tags including paragraph, line break, header and horizontal rule.
	
#### Lesson 1:3 - Attributes of Tags

Now that people are getting a little familiar with the HTML concepts, we step back a bit and introduce attributes and describe how they customize and configure how a tag is displayed in the browser.  Several examples or  describe to be played with.
	
#### Lesson 1:4 - Links and Images

With a knowledge of how to customize tags, its time to gain some experience with some of the more advanced and fun tags in the HTML language.  Here we introduce the image tag and allow students to start putting pictures into their pages.  Then we introduce the anchor/link tag that make the web a "web".  Finally we put the two tags together to create image links.

#### Lesson 1:5 - Lists

Broadening out our knowledge of different types of HTML tags, we introduce ordered and unordered lists in this lesson.  We also learn how to create lists within lists. 
	
#### Lesson 1:6 - Tables

Tables are one of HTML's most important constructs (group of tags).  This lesson covers all the basics of building tables.  It also ties in what has been learned in previous lessons, demonstrating how we can put different kinds of content in our table's cells.
	
#### Lesson 1:7 - Forms

Finally we talk about forms and how to get input back from a user of our HTML programs.  By the end of this lesson we are starting to do some pretty advanced things and have a very well rounded introduction to HTML.
