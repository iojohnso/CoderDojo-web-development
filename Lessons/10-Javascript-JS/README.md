10 - Javascript:  Getting started and variables
===============================================

Goal:  For us to get some javascript running in a web page and to learn a new programming concept:  the variable.

Javascript is fun because its a "real" programming langauge.
HTML programming is fun but its mostly about presentations and layouts.  When we start adding Javascript to our files, we
have basically all the power of a complete language for expressing ourselves.


#### Step 1:  Create a page we're going to work with.

For this set of tutorials, lets create a new page.  Create a new page called:

  TestJavascript.html
	
In your new file, type the following code and then run it in the browser.

You should see this message:


	Javascript code coming soon!!!
	
Save the file with the changes and open a web browser like internet explorer, firefox, chrome or safari.

For the url, type the location and name of the file.  On my computer, I type this into the browser:

	file:///Users/mrddqb/MyWebPage.html
	
The class instructors will help you get your browser displaying your file.

Once you are able to see the page in the browser, consider creating a bookmark so you can easily get back to the page.
