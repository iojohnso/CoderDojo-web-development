10 - Javascript:  Getting started and variables
===============================================

Goal:  For us to get some javascript running in a web page and to learn a new programming concept:  the variable.

Javascript is fun because its a "real" programming langauge.
HTML programming is fun but its mostly about presentations and layouts.  When we start adding Javascript to our files, we
have basically all the power of a complete language for expressing ourselves.


#### Step 1:  Create a page we're going to work with.

For this set of tutorials, lets create a new page.  Create a new page called:

  TestJavascript.html
	
In your new file, type the following code and then run it in the browser.

	<html >
		<head>
			<title>JavaScript Tutorial</title>
		</head>
		<body>
  	
			<H1>Javascript code coming soon!!!
	
			<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
				// here is where we will code...
				</script>
		</body>
	</html>


You should see this message:


	Javascript code coming soon!!!
	
Let's talk about what's going on here.  Almost everything we see here, you have already learned.  This is just 
a normal html document.  It has nothing to display but a simple header (h1 tag) to proudly announce that soon we
will be writing Javascript.

The cool thing about Javascript is that it works right in the same browswer that shows our HTML - without any changes.
So all we have to do learn the new tags for writing Javascript code (<script></script>) and we are ready to start.

When the <script> tag is seen, the computer switches from building web pages for you and starts building a Javascipt
program.  Right now, our program doesn't do anything at all except show a comment.  

Comments are notes that programmers write for themselves and others who have to look at the program later.  Comments 
help you remember what your program is supposed to do as it gets bigger and more complex.  The // characters means 
"everything from here to the end of the line is just a comment for me... please don't try to run it Mr Computer"



For the url, type the location and name of the file.  On my computer, I type this into the browser:

	file:///Users/mrddqb/MyWebPage.html
	
The class instructors will help you get your browser displaying your file.

Once you are able to see the page in the browser, consider creating a bookmark so you can easily get back to the page.
