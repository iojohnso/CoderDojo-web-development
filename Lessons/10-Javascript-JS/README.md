10 - Javascript:  Getting started and variables
===============================================

Goal:  For us to get some javascript running in a web page and to learn a new programming concept:  the variable.

Javascript is fun because its a "real" programming langauge.
HTML programming is fun but its mostly about presentations and layouts.  When we start adding Javascript to our files, we
have basically all the power of a complete language for expressing ourselves.
